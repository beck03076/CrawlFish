########## HELP FILE #######################

All the log files generated should be in this format "*.dat"

Create a folder every day to accumulate all the log files. Folder should be named with the date. Folder name should be like this "29-May-2012"

Open the master script "validate-logs" file and change the folder_path and script_path.

folder_path - defines the path where the log folders, explained in step 2, are created
script_path - defines the path where the master and awk scripts are placed in your system

--------- Now we are ready to run the script ----------

Define a cron job that runs at the end of every day, which calls this master script with the log folder name as argument

A folder "final_logs" will be created in the parent folder, which will have two files "final_impressions.dat" and "final_clicks.dat"

--------- CRON JOB steps -------------

1) Calls the master script "validate-logs" with the log folder name as argument
2) Feeds the files, which are created in "final_logs" folder, to a temp table in crawlfishdevdb database along with the type (either "clicks" or "impressions" based on the feed file that you load) and the log_date set to the folder date
